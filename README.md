# Goals & Vision

My intention is to record and share my Rust journey. I've read the entire Rust books within a week time: the official Rust and async book. From now on, I will focus on deeper expertising myself throughout series of projects with the intention to exercise.

After all that I would like to publish crates for the community and my own ambitions.
